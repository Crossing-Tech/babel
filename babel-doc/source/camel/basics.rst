Babel Camel Basics
==================

The Babel Camel Basics part exposes which basic statement may be defined.

Messages
++++++++

In Babel Camel, the base interface which models a message which passes through the route is called Message. A Message contains a payload called body.
From Camel point of view, a Babel Message may be understood as the in Message of an Exchange with required methods to read and write the Exchange properties.

For more details, please have a look at the `Camel Message Specification <http://babel-dsl.github.io/current/test-reports/BabelCamelSpec.html#A+CamelMessage+should>`_

Basics
++++++

A simple route without changing or routing the message. The output will be the same as the input.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/CamelDSLSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-basic-1

The producer may set the exchange as InOnly by setting the second argument of to, to false. This would override the default behaviour of the producer.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/CamelDSLSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-basic-2

The producer may set the exchange as InOut by setting the second argument of to, to true. This would override the default behaviour of the producer.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/CamelDSLSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-basic-3

Route Id
++++++++

The **routeId** will give an id to the route, then this id can be used for the monitoring or during testing.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RouteIdSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-routeId

The **routeId** can not be specified as null nor an empty string.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RouteIdSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-routeId-exception-1

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RouteIdSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-routeId-exception-2

.. note::
   The **routeId** keyword is member of a set of keywords which should follow directly the **from** keyword or any keyword of this set.


As
++++

A basic example with type transformation. The keyword *as* will coerce the type of the message passing within a route to a given type.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/AsSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-as


RequireAs
+++++++++

A basic example with type requirement. The *requireAs* will type the exchange body for the next keyword and will accept only a message with the given type.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RequireAsSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-requireAs

The **requiredAs** lets you ensure you will always receive the expected body type. For example, the following may not work.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RequireAsSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-requireAs-exception

.. warning:: Camel also provides tools to handle data type at runtime (which may be referred to as "runtime typing"). This may cause the regular typing to modify your data after the *requireAs* keyword depending on your ecosystem. Unfortunately, there is no way for Babel to prevent such variable behaviour.

Logging
+++++++

With a **log**, you can log a defined string (which may use Camel Simple Expression Language) and define:

* the Log level
* the Log name
* a marker for this Log event

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/LogSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-logging

Sub routes
++++++++++

With a **sub**, you can define the following steps as part of a new route.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/SubRouteSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-sub

This example would just create two routes:

* the "master-route" from the "input" to the "before" to the "subroute"
* the "subroute" from the "subroute" to the "after"

Thus, **sub** may be seen as an inline channel. The first goal of the sub route is to separate, at runtime, the two routes in a proper manner without requiring more than required code. The sub routes may also be interesting for example in `Error Handling <errormanagement.html>`_.

Route configuration
+++++++++++++++++++

Callbacks may be added to a given route in order to manage its lifecycle such as :

* **onInit**
* **onStart**
* **onSuspend**
* **onResume**
* **onStop**
* **onRemove**

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RouteConfigurationSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-route-conf-2

Concerning the exchange lifecycle :

* **onExchangeBegin**
* **onExchangeDone**

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RouteConfigurationSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-route-conf-3

Moreover, you may prevent a route from being started automatically using the **noAutoStartup** keyword.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/RouteConfigurationSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-route-conf-1



Id
++++

The **id** will set an id to the previous EIP. This may be useful while vizaulizing your route or for statisticts.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/IdSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-id-eip

The **id** may also set the consumer id, being called before or after the **routId**.

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/IdSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-id-from


Babel provides a way to define eip ids by default (without using **id**). The default naming strategy provided by Babel stands as
``routeId_sequenceNumber_patternType_details`` where

- ``routeId`` is th routeId that labels your route, if any.
- ``sequenceNumber`` is the index of the pattern in the route.
- ``patternType`` is the type of pattern (on 3 chars), as end, pro, spl, ...
- ``details`` is the information specific to your pattern as the endpoint URI or the Class and function of your processor.

To modify this default behavior, you may create your own naming strategy in your ``RouteBuilder`` such as:

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/CamelDSLSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-id-strategy

You may shortcut the Babel naming strategy by tagging your RouteBuilder with the ``NoDefaultIds`` trait:

.. includecode:: ../../../babel-camel/babel-camel-core/src/test/scala/io/xtech/babel/camel/IdSpec.scala#doc:babel-camel-no-id
