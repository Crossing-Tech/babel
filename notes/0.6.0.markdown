First open source version
=========================

The initial open source release of Babel essentially presents a set of keyword to be used with Apache Camel. It also provides a core module (Babel fish) in order to implement other DSL.


Keywords
--------

- Basics
   - sources and sinks (from, to, sub)
   - route hooks (routeId, onStart, onInit, ...)
   - exchange hooks (onExchangeDone, ...)
   - logging (log)
- Typing (requireAs, marshal, ...)
- Routing (choice, multicast, recipientList, filter, aggregate, split, vaidate)
- Transformation (enrich, pollEnrich, process, resequence, sort, bean)
- Error handling (handle, on[Throwable], continued, deadletter, loggingErrorHandler, defaultErrorHandler)


Mock extension
--------------

- Define a subset DSL (Mock) for Babel Camel which may be mix in RouteBuilder to add functionnalities


Feature
-------

- Integration with the legacy Apache Camel context (RouteBuilder)
- Integration with the Camel Spring context (SpringRouteBuilder)

Improvement
-----------

- Improve the support of scala types (scala.Int, scala.Byte, etc...)
